As a recent thesis-track M.S. graduate from UIUC ECE, I develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems using AI/ML, with an emphasis on Generative Models and Conversational AI. I am proficient in tech transfer from research to products, as well as product improvements in NLP and ASR. I am familiar with CI/CD, PostgreSQL, Docker, K8s and GCP. I am passionate about LLMs tuning and application for healthcare and education, but also open to all possible fields. My main programming language is Python, and I got exposure(from academia and Industry) to a wide range of programming languages including C++, Rust, Golang and Cuda. Here is a short version of my [Resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/\_data/Resume.pdf).

I take photos, roadtrip, hike, hit the gym in my spare time.
I enjoy sci-Fi and history the most, while I read various books.
My favorite food is 🌮(Si, me gusta tacos!).
